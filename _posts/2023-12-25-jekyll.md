# Setup a documentation site using jekyll
How to use jekyll to setup a documentation site and host it on github pages.

## Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```
Setting the envrionment variables so we don't have to install as root
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install bundler, a gem management environment for Ruby projects

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Creating the template
Go to [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) and click `Use this Template` > `Create new repository`, name the Repo `USERNAME.github.io`

## Clone the new repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
```

## Starting Jekyll for the first time
Go to the root directory of your site and run 

```bash
cd <repository>
$ bundle
```

When the installation is done you can start jekyll for the first time:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

Your site will run at 127.0.0.1:4000

## Writing your first post
Add a new *.md file to the _posts folder, it is important that the naming is `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`.

The header of the created file should look like this

```yml
---
title: Title of the post
author: Author
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
categories: [some, categories]
tags: [yourtag]
---
```

If you're using the `author: Author` Tag you have to add the `authors.yml` file to the _data folder with the following content:

```yml
Author:
  name: Firstname Lastname
  url: https://myawesomesite.com
```

## Preparing github Actions 

![Settings](/assets/images/github_pages_actions.png)

On the repository at github you'll have to go to the `Settings` Tab, select `Pages` and set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.

## Publishing to github Pages

When we're done with our post we can commit and push to our remote branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My first post, yay!"
git push
```

You might have to verify with your ssh credentials when pushing.
